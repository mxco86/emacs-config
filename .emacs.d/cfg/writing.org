* Writing Aids Configuration
*** Spell Check
    Enable spell check on all text buffers. Flyspell for other modes is added
    in the specific mode configuration. We don't defer loading of Flyspell as
    it has some interactions with org-mode (setting flyspell-delayed-commands)
    that cause intermittent start up errors when loading is deferred
