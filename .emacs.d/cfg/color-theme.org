* Colour Theme Configuration
  - Use the base16-emacs theme implementation
  - https://github.com/belak/base16-emacs
  - This has a version of solarized-dark which is the theme I generally use
  - The theme is loaded and then a few minor tweaks applied before reloading
    to apply these
  - The cursor colour is also changed after loading as it's set to a horrible
    red by default
