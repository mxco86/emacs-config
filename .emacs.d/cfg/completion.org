* Completion Configuration
*** Minibuffer Completion / Incremental Search
    - Ivy is a interactive interface for anything that is completed in the
      minibuffer
    - https://oremacs.com/swiper/
    - It gives a vertical list of completions in the minibuffer and is useful
      in lots of contexts where input is required
    - For some reason it's split into multiple packages and the recommended
      way of installing is to install ~counsel~, a package of completion
      functions, which brings in the rest as dependencies
    - The ~swiper~ package provides a completions list for an incremental
      buffer search which works well
    - For this reason we install ~counsel~ here and then configure all the
      packages in the config block

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package counsel
    :ensure t
    :commands (swiper counsel-find-file counsel-M-x)
    :init
    (bind-key "C-s" 'swiper)
    (bind-key "C-x C-m" 'counsel-M-x)
    (bind-key "C-x C-f" 'counsel-find-file)
    :config
    (ivy-mode 1)
    (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t
          ivy-count-format "(%d/%d) "
          ivy-initial-inputs-alist nil
          ivy-re-builders-alist '((swiper . ivy--regex-plus)
                                  (t . ivy--regex-fuzzy))
          ivy-extra-directories nil
          ivy-wrap t))

  (with-eval-after-load 'counsel
    (let ((done (where-is-internal #'ivy-done ivy-minibuffer-map t))
          (alt  (where-is-internal #'ivy-alt-done ivy-minibuffer-map t)))
      (define-key counsel-find-file-map done #'ivy-alt-done)
      (define-key counsel-find-file-map alt  #'ivy-done)))

  (use-package ivy-rich
    :after ivy
    :hook (ivy-mode . ivy-rich-mode)
    :config
    (setq ivy-rich-path-style 'abbrev))
  #+END_SRC

*** Command Suggestions
    - Smex is a command suggestion tool that brings up recently used commands
      in the minibuffer
    - It is used by Ivy to order command suggestions by most recently used
    - https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package smex
      :ensure t
      :after counsel
      :config
      (smex-initialize))
    #+END_SRC

*** Fuzzy Matching
    - Flx is a fuzzy-matching package used by Ivy
    - https://github.com/lewang/flx

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package flx :ensure t :after counsel)
    #+END_SRC

*** In-Buffer Autocompletion
    - Use company for simple in-buffer autocompletion in most contexts
    - http://company-mode.github.io/
    - There's not much config here as it mostly just works
    - I enable completions globally which might be a bit overkill but I'm too
      lazy to configure it everywhere individually

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package company
        :ensure t
        :init
        (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
        :config
        (setq company-tooltip-align-annotations t)
        (define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-n") #'company-select-next)
        (define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-p") #'company-select-previous))
    #+END_SRC
